# Machine Learning Used Laptop Price Estimation
Estimation of a used laptop's price thanks to Machine Learning

My partner Emre Erin (see profile link below) and I developed this application as capstone project of Machine Learning course in Software Engineering Department at Celal Bayar University, Turkey. Since we coudln't find a well collected dataset, we created the dataset. So we couldn't get a very efficient dataset but it is a good starting to Machine Learning and we liked the ML a lot :)

You can see the app as web UI at http://azure2.aydinbulut.com/

It will give the estimated price in Turkish Lira but I'am thinking adding currency conversion.
